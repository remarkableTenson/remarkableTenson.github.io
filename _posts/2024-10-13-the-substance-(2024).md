pretty fun watch. kept me engaged throughout except the last 15 mintues, more on that later. sometimes I need to be reminded that life is a lot easier for pretty people, and this movie did excatly that. men are potrayed from a women's prespective in this movie, whereas women are potrayed from both genders prespective. some of my observations -

1. the showrunners metal shoe heels and the harsh sound as it hits the floor - reflective of constant critisim women have had to face in the past and present(at least in some parts of the world)
2. lunch scene with the showrunner - reflective of how men are held to a lower standard when it comes to etiquette and how unapologetic men can be
3. did Sue want to hurt her matrix or did she because of societal conditioning
4. did Sparkle want to save Sue or did she do it just for the validation
 
I had to skip through most of last 15 mintues of the movie since I couldn't watch Sparkle's head being bashed into bathroom mirror. I wish the movie had done a better job in terms of communication between the Matrix and Other Self. even as they faced off, they didn't exchange a single word.
