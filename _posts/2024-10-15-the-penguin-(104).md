I was not very excited to watch this particular episode inspite of loving all previous episodes. mainly becuase Collin Ferall mentioned during the press tour that fourth episode focuses solely on Sofia and her past. but manoman, did they make me feel sorry and happy for Sofia by the end of the episode. I unknowingly/unwillingly rooted for Oz all this while, I want to root against him but since the only backstory we are given is his, it made it very difficult for me. not anymore.

the slowburn during the final act and the way it's carried out - without uttering a single word is ultimate motion picture. reminded me of FeLiNa. both are equally great in their own way. I could feel her hurting at Arkham. I could feel the anger. makes me want to watch the entire series from the begining again just to watch Oz and Sofia interact. maybe they underplayed Sofia's resentment towards Oz or maybe Sofia's resentment towards her father helped Oz in a certain sense? although, I'll have to watch the episodes to even know if the resentment was underplayed.

great acting, great writing, great cinematography, great music choice towards the end. I wish they'd showed a little more of her life in Arkham, history with Oz and how she got out eventually.
